## Introduction

The Web3 Local Testnet project allows developers to build and test their DApps locally. This project leverages the power of the Ethereum blockchain, providing a sandbox environment to experiment without the need for real Ether. With React as the front-end framework, you can create dynamic user interfaces that interact seamlessly with smart contracts.

## Features

- **Local Blockchain**: Run a local Ethereum network for testing.
- **Smart Contracts**: Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts using Solidity.
- **React Integration**: Build user interfaces using React that communicate with your smart contracts.
- **Wallet Support**: Integrate with wallets like MetaMask for easy transaction management.
- **Testing Framework**: Use Hardhat for testing your contracts and DApp functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Framework**: React
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development Environment**: Hardhat
- **Wallet**: MetaMask
- **Networking**: EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

## Installation

To get started with the Web3 Local Testnet, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CTuei/web3-local-testnet.git
   cd web3-local-testnet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Local Blockchain**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   Open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

5. **Start the React App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your DApp should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once your local blockchain is running and your smart contracts are deployed, you can interact with your DApp through the web interface. Here are some key features to explore:

- **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask to connect your wallet to the DApp.
- **Send Transactions**: Execute transactions and interact with smart contracts.
- **View State**: Check the current state of your smart contracts directly from the UI.
